# TODOS
- [d0n3] configurable GNNs (to be passed to the agent)
- [d0n3] make sure BARK-ML agent runs with the benchmark runner (runs without deepcopy)
- [d0n3] do not like the tracking system with pandas + fix this + units
- [d0n3] scenario generation using configurable scenario generation
- [d0n3] experiments + checkpoint folder + training tag
- run in cluster and singularity
- good highway and merging scenarios
- random seeds of agents
- visualize graph
- visualize agents that are being included
- visualize training

# Outcome
- Multiple trained experiments that are benchmarkable
