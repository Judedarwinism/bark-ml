# TODOS
- [d0n3] configurable GNNs (to be passed to the agent)
- [d0n3] make sure BARK-ML agent runs with the benchmark runner (runs without deepcopy)
- [NEXT] do not like the tracking system with pandas + fix this + units

# FUTURE TODOS
- better checkpoint management system (+ git lfs to push and pull these)
...
- bazel build in docker & singularity & run on cluster
-> train_cluster: deploy, build, run

# Outcome
- Multiple trained configurations that are benchmarkable
