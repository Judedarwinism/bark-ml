# TODOS
- configurable GNNs (to be passed to the agent)
- make sure BARK-ML agents runs with benchmark runner
- better checkpoint management system (+ git lfs to push and pull these)
- do not like the tracking system with pandas

...
- bazel build in docker & singularity & run on cluster
-> train_cluster: deploy, build, run


# Outcome
- Multiple trained configurations that are benchmarkable
